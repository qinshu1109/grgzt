# Stream B: Text Preprocessing & Segmentation

## Scope
- Implement text segmentation algorithm (titles, paragraphs, lists)
- Text formatting and noise filtering
- Large text processing performance optimization

## Files
- main.js (text processing functions)

## Progress
- ✅ Starting text preprocessing implementation
- ✅ Implemented cleanText() function for text formatting and normalization
- ✅ Implemented segmentText() function for structured text segmentation (titles, paragraphs, lists)
- ✅ Implemented filterNoise() function to remove copyright notices, contact info, and irrelevant content
- ✅ Added processLargeText() for performance monitoring and large text processing
- ✅ Added preprocessTextAdvanced() as main pipeline with batch processing support
- ✅ Added processLargeTextInBatches() for handling very large documents (200k+ characters)
- ✅ Includes comprehensive noise pattern matching and performance tracking
- ✅ Supports progress callbacks and memory optimization

## Implementation Details

### Functions Added:
1. **cleanText(text)** - Normalizes whitespace, removes special characters, handles punctuation
2. **segmentText(text)** - Segments text into titles, paragraphs, and lists with proper structure
3. **filterNoise(text)** - Removes 20+ types of noise patterns (copyright, contact info, etc.)
4. **processLargeText(text, callback)** - Performance monitoring with progress tracking
5. **preprocessTextAdvanced(text, options)** - Main pipeline with configurable options
6. **processLargeTextInBatches(text, options)** - Batch processing for very large documents

### Key Features:
- Supports documents up to 500k characters
- Batch processing for memory optimization
- Progress callbacks for UI feedback
- Comprehensive noise filtering patterns
- Structured text segmentation with metadata
- Performance metrics and monitoring

## Testing Notes
- Ready for integration with keyword matching system
- All functions include proper error handling and validation
- Performance optimized for large documents (200k+ characters)
